        <h1>My First Week Learning Web Developmen</h1>
        <p>
          Learning web development has been exciting! <br />
          I started with HTML, learned about tags, and created my first page. <br />
          I also broke a lot of things... but that's part of learning.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic HTML structure</li>
          <li>How to use hadings and paragraphs</li>
          <li>Linkeding pages with <a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Challenges</h2>
